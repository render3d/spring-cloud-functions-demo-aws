# Spring Cloud Function Healthcheck Lambda

This module contains the source code for the lambda mapped to the `GET /healthcheck` path of the Serverless API.

The developer understands that [health checks can be done in other ways](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-actuators).
Here, a dedicated Spring Cloud Function for a health check is used for demonstration purposes only.
